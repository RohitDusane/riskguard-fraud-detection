# RiskGuard — Fintech Fraud Risk Scoring MLOps Platform

A fraud-risk scoring service built to demonstrate the full engineering
lifecycle around a machine learning model — not just training one, but
serving it, containerizing it, orchestrating it, monitoring it, and
deploying it to the cloud with a real CI/CD pipeline.

The project is intentionally **cost-conscious**: it runs on a single AWS
EC2 instance with K3s rather than a managed Kubernetes control plane,
because that's the honest, defensible architecture for a project at this
stage — not because it's a compromise being hidden.

```

No NAT Gateway, no Application Load Balancer, no RDS — each of those adds
$15-35/month for capability this project doesn't need yet. Total
infrastructure cost: **~$16-18/month** on-demand.

## Dependency management

- `requirements-serving.txt` — minimal runtime deps baked into the production Docker image (kept small deliberately)
- `requirements-dev.txt` — testing, linting, and local dev tools (pytest, ruff, locust)
- `requirements.txt` — full pinned environment for local development
- `pyproject.toml` — project metadata and tool config (ruff, pytest settings)

---

## Repository structure
K3s ships with Traefik as its built-in ingress controller, so the two
`traefik-*.yaml` files configure HTTPS termination (Let's Encrypt) and
redirect middleware directly through K3s rather than standing up a
separate ingress controller or an AWS ALB.

### Docker Compose (API + Prometheus + Grafana)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Local K3s

## Testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
ruff check .
locust -f tests/locustfile.py --host http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Monitoring & alerting

Prometheus scrapes the API's `/metrics` endpoint (via
`prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`) and kube-state-metrics (scoped to
`deployments` and `pods` only — least-privilege, not the full default
resource set). **18 alert rules** cover API availability, error rate,
p95 latency, model drift/accuracy metrics, and Kubernetes-level failure
modes (OOMKilled, pod restart loops, unavailable replicas). Alertmanager
routes `critical` vs `warning` severities to separate Slack channels.

---

## Honest current limitations

These are real, not hedging boilerplate:

- **Single EC2 node, no HA.** A node failure takes the whole deployment
  down. Multi-AZ + ALB + ASG is the upgrade path, at roughly 2x the cost.
- **Model evaluation metrics are placeholders.** `model_accuracy`,
  `model_prediction_drift`, etc. are instrumented and alertable, but no
  scheduled evaluation job has populated real values yet — this is
  tracked as a known gap, not hidden.
- **ECR pull tokens expire every 12 hours** on this single-node setup
  (no IRSA-style credential provider like EKS has). A refresh CronJob is
  the planned fix.
- **Transaction history in the frontend is browser-local** (`localStorage`),
  not backend-persisted — fine for a demo, not for multi-user use.

## Credits & inspiration

The fraud/risk-scoring concept was inspired by
[Amir Hossein Honardoust's Financial Fraud Risk Engine](https://github.com/AmirhosseinHonardoust/Financial-Fraud-Risk-Engine).
This project extends that concept into a full MLOps deployment
architecture (containerization, Kubernetes, CI/CD, cloud deployment,
observability) rather than the original modeling scope.
